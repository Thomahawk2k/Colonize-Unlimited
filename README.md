# What is Colonize Unlimited©

Colonize Unlimited© is a mod (:P) designed to allow the player greater freedom in their colonization, especially mid-to-late game. Instead of being limited to planets that already house life, one with Colonize Unlimited© will be able to colonize every rock-based planet, provided they have toasters . In addition, the player with Colonize Unlimited© will allow the player to make uninhabitable (rock-based) planets habitable using terraforming techniques in the late game.


# Features

Tile system for barren, molten and frozen planets.
Amazing tile artwork, made by me! (On a more serious note, if you feel you can do better, don't be shy and send it to me, I'll give you credit.)

Possibility to land pops in this new tile system, more specifically robot pops, as organic pops won't survive there (or in stellaris' case, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off become agitated because their happiness cap is 0%). 
Possibility to now terraform barren, molten and frozen planets into planets that are habitable. (And consequently, then you can send pops there, woo!)

Four brandnew techs to enable you to actually terraform those hellish lands.

I also removed PDS's skins for mars and the moon in the prescripted sol system, as they otherwise don't look like the planet they're terraformed into after being terraformed. You can manually change this by going into the mod files /common/solar_system_initializers, click the only file in there and ctrl + f 'luna' and 'mars' in both cases you see an hashtag before one line of code, you can remove that hashtag and they will have their skins back, but they will keep that skin throughout the game no matter what you do with them as stated earlier.
