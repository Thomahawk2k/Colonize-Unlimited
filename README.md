# What is Colonize Unlimited©

Colonize Unlimited© is a mod (:P) designed to allow the player greater freedom in their colonization, especially mid-to-late game. Instead of being limited to planets that already house life, one with Colonize Unlimited© will be able to colonize every rock-based planet, provided they have toasters . In addition, the player with Colonize Unlimited© will allow the player to make uninhabitable (rock-based) planets habitable using terraforming techniques in the late game.

# Features

* Colonization:
  * Tile system for gas giants, barren, molten and frozen planets.
  * Ability to colonize all planet types
    * New planets keep a 0% habitability which can be improved by techs/traits
  * New building to increase habitability
* Terraforming:
  * New techs to allow you to terraform all planets but Gas Giants.
  * Replaced terraforming resources with:
    * Hydrogen
    * Oxygen
    * Nitrogen
    * Carbon
    * Water
    * Carbon Dioxide

* Other changes:
  * Removed PDX's skins for mars and the moon in the prescripted sol system
    * as they otherwise don't look like the planet they're terraformed into after being terraformed. You can manually change this by going into the mod files /common/solar_system_initializers, click the only file in there and ctrl + f 'luna' and 'mars' in both cases you see an hashtag before one line of code, you can remove that hashtag and they will have their skins back, but they will keep that skin throughout the game no matter what you do with them as stated earlier.
