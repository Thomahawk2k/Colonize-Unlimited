 pc_barren_tile: "Barren Terrain"
 pc_barren_tile_desc: "Lifeless terrain with no natural air supply."
 tech_artificial_atmosphere:0 "Artificial Atmospheres"
 tech_artificial_atmosphere_desc:1 "Recent breakthroughs in humidity regulators and chemical dispersal units, combined with gases from other planets, will allow us to create an atmosphere from scratch that could allow habitability where needed.\n\n"
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_ART_ATMOSPHERE_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Artificial Atmospheres" 
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_ART_ATMOSPHERE_DESC: "§HArtificial Atmospheres§!\nAllows us to set up artificial atmospheres on barren worlds, in turn allowing us to terraform them."
 pc_toxic_tile: "Toxic Terrain"
 pc_toxic_tile_desc: "Lifeless terrain hidden under a thick layer of toxic gases."
 tech_stimulated_solar_winds:0 "Controllable Solar Winds"
 tech_stimulated_solar_winds_desc:1 "By harnessing the solar winds that occasionally flare up from a star, we gained capabilities that we could previously hardly dream of..."
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_STIM_SOLAR_WINDS_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Controllable Solar Winds"
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_STIM_SOLAR_WINDS_DESC: "§HControllable Solar Winds§!\nAllows us to steer solar winds from stars to planets, allowing us to strip away a toxic atmosphere and replace it with a habitable one."
 pc_barren_cold_tile: "Barren Terrain"
 pc_barren_cold_tile_desc: "Lifeless terrain with no natural air supply."
 tech_extreme_greenhouse:0 "Extreme Greenhouse Harnessing"
 tech_extreme_greenhouse_desc:1 "By artificially setting up an extraordinarily high amount of greenhouse gases such as carbondioxide and methane in a planet's troposphere, we can warm up planets far outside their star's habitable zone."
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_EXTREME_GREENHOUSE_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Extreme Greenhouse Harnessing"
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_EXTREME_GREENHOUSE_DESC: "§HExtreme Greenhouse Harnessing§!\nAllows us to add an extraordinarily high amount of greenhouse gases to frozen planets, in turn warming them up and allowing for terraformation."
 pc_frozen_tile: "Frozen Terrain"
 pc_frozen_tile_desc: "Terrain buried under a thick layer of ice with barely any atmosphere above that."
 pc_molten_tile: "Molten Terrain"
 pc_molten_tile_desc: "Half-molten lava terrain with a very thin atmosphere above it."
 tech_high_alt_solarprotection:0 "High Altitude Solar Protection"
 tech_high_alt_solarprotection_desc:1 "By building a solar protection 'dam' on very high altitudes, we can regulate the amount of sunlight falling to the surface of the planet."
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_HIGH_ALT_SOLARPROTECTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! High Altitude Solar Protection"
 TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_HIGH_ALT_SOLARPROTECTION_DESC: "§HHigh Altitude Solarprotection§!\nBeing able to limit solar heat on the surface, the surface of molten planets will solidify, quickly lowering temperatures to habitable levels."
 sr_nitrogen:0 "Nitrogen"
 sr_nitrogen_desc:0 "Found universally on habitable worlds, nitrogen is one of the primary components of organic life and required to terraform planets that do not house enough of it to sustain life."
 sr_oxygen:0 "Oxygen"
 sr_oxygen_desc:0 "Found universally on habitable worlds, oxygen is a crucial element in photosynthesis and consequently of the carbon cycle. Planets that do not house enough of it to sustain life will need oxygen to be terraformed."
 sr_carbon_dioxide:0 "Carbon Dioxide"
 sr_carbon_dioxide_desc:0 "Likely being the most well known greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide is a crucial element in warming up planets, additionally, being a crucial element in photosynthesis, planets without an atmosphere will need at least some amount of it in order to allow terraformation."
 sr_hydrogen:0 "Hydrogen"
 sr_hydrogen_desc:0 "Found in stars (although inaccessible there) and in gas giants, hydrogen is not a crucial element in terraforming, we can however turn it into water together with the oxygen in the atmosphere, giving us energy as a by-effect."
 sr_water:0 "Water"
 sr_water_desc:0 "Being a crucial element in organic life, water, or dihydro monoxide, is universally available on any habitable planet, even though it may be scarce in some climates. Water is crucial to make dry planets wetter and inhospitable planets hospitable."
 sr_carbon:0 "Diamond"
 sr_carbon_desc:0 "Being crystallized carbon in it's purest form, diamond is one of the hardest naturally occuring resource known. Additionally, it reflects. By using special aerosol techniques we can limit the sunlight to reach the planet's surface, allowing us to effectively cool down planets in a reverse greenhouse."
