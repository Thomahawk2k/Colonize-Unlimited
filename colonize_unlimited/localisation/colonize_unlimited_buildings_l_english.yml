  building_hydrofusion_plant:0 "Hydroburning Plant"
  building_hydrofusion_plant_desc:1 "Hydroburning Plants burn hydrogen together with oxygen from the atmosphere into water that can be used in terraformation processes. As an added bonus, the energy that comes free can be used as well."
  building_gas_catcher_1:0 "Basic Gas Farm"
  building_gas_catcher_1_desc:1 "Gas farms are used to farm gases from the planets atmosphere. In the avarage atmosphere of a habitable planet is 70-80% nitrogen and ca. 20% oxygen, by using gas farms we can take some of it and send it to other worlds."
  building_gas_catcher_2:0 "Large Gas Farm"
  building_gas_catcher_2_desc:1 "By allocating even more space and building even larger catchers, we can double the amount of gases we can farm from the atmosphere."
  building_burning_facility:0 "Carbondioxide Mine"
  building_burning_facility_desc:0 "By burning carbonbased materials we can mine carbondioxide from the atmosphere, a crucial element in heating up planets and moons that would otherwise be frozen."
  building_crystallizing_facility:0 "Crystallizing Facility"
  building_crystallizing_facility_desc:0 "By splitting carbondioxide into carbon and dioxide and then synthetically crystallizing the carbon, we can create diamonds, who in turn can be pulverized and sent into the atmosphere of planets, allowing a reverse greenhouse effect and a significant cooldown of planets."
  building_art_biosphere:0 "Enclosed Biosphere Center"
  building_art_biosphere_desc:0 "Central region where the enclosed biosphere on $PLANET$ is being regulated and maintained."
  building_water_extractor:0 "Water Extractor"
  building_water_extractor_desc:0 "Extract water directly from lakes and oceans with a large pump or from icecaps with a melting pump."
