  tech_artificial_atmosphere:0 "Artificial Atmospheres"
  tech_artificial_atmosphere_desc:1 "Recent breakthroughs in humidity regulators and chemical dispersal units, combined with gases from other planets, will allow us to create an atmosphere from scratch that could allow habitability where needed.\n\n"
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_ART_ATMOSPHERE_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Artificial Atmospheres"
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_ART_ATMOSPHERE_DESC: "§HArtificial Atmospheres§!\nAllows us to set up artificial atmospheres on barren worlds, in turn allowing us to terraform them."
  tech_stimulated_solar_winds:0 "Controllable Solar Winds"
  tech_stimulated_solar_winds_desc:1 "By harnessing the solar winds that occasionally flare up from a star, we gained capabilities that we could previously hardly dream of..."
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_STIM_SOLAR_WINDS_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Controllable Solar Winds"
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_STIM_SOLAR_WINDS_DESC: "§HControllable Solar Winds§!\nAllows us to steer solar winds from stars to planets, allowing us to strip away a toxic atmosphere and replace it with a habitable one."
  tech_extreme_greenhouse:0 "Extreme Greenhouse Harnessing"
  tech_extreme_greenhouse_desc:1 "By artificially setting up an extraordinarily high amount of greenhouse gases such as carbondioxide and methane in a planet's troposphere, we can warm up planets far outside their star's habitable zone."
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_EXTREME_GREENHOUSE_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Extreme Greenhouse Harnessing"
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_EXTREME_GREENHOUSE_DESC: "§HExtreme Greenhouse Harnessing§!\nAllows us to add an extraordinarily high amount of greenhouse gases to frozen planets, in turn warming them up and allowing for terraformation."
  tech_high_alt_solarprotection:0 "Diamond Altitude Aerosol"
  tech_high_alt_solarprotection_desc:1 "By setting up a reverse greenhouse effect on very high altitudes, we can regulate the amount of sunlight falling to the surface of the planet."
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_HIGH_ALT_SOLARPROTECTION_TITLE: "§HUnlocks Feature:§! Diamond Altitude Aerosol"
  TECH_UNLOCK_TERRAFORMING_HIGH_ALT_SOLARPROTECTION_DESC: "§HHigh Altitude Solarprotection§!\nBy pulverizing and spreading diamond particles in the atmosphere, we can deflect sunlight that would otherwise reach the surface, in turn allowing us to cooldown planets."
  tech_atmosphere_farming:0 "Atmosphere Farming"
  tech_atmosphere_farming_desc:1 "By building filters, we can save up gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, to be used for terraforming or other purposes."
  tech_atmosphere_farming_2:0 "Atmosphere Farming II"
  tech_atmosphere_farming_2_desc:1 "Through advancements in filter technology, as well as more efficient allocation, we can double the amounts of gases farmed."
  tech_atmosphere_mining:0 "Atmosphere Mining"
  tech_atmosphere_mining_desc:1 "By burning fossile fuels that are no longer in use due to climatechange effects and catching the resulting gas, we can reserve carbondioxide for planets that could actually use it..."
  tech_hydrogen_burning:0 "Hydrogen Burning"
  tech_hydrogen_burning_desc:1 "By burning hydrogen mined from gas giants with atmosphere oxygen, we can get water to terraform other planets."
  tech_artificial_diamonds:0 "Synthetic Diamonds"
  tech_artificial_diamonds_desc:1 "By splitting the carbon from the dioxide in carbondioxide, we get carbon in it's purest form, allowing us to crystallize it into diamonds useful for cooling down planets if sent into the atmosphere."
  tech_hydroburning:0 "Hydroburning"
  tech_hydroburning_desc:0 "-"
  tech_art_biosphere:0 "Enclosed Biospheres"
  tech_art_biosphere_desc:1 "By setting up enclosed biospheres on uninhabitable planets we can allow organics to live there and execute operations that would otherwise only be possible with robots."
  tech_floating_cities:0 "Floating Cities"
  tech_floating_cities_desc:0 "By attaching floating devices to platforms, we can float entire cities on thick gases."
  TECH_UNLOCK_DOSAKI_FLOATING_CITIES_CHANGE_TITLE:0 "Floating Cities"
  TECH_UNLOCK_DOSAKI_FLOATING_CITIES_CHANGE_DESC:0 "Allows us to colonize Gas Giants by building floating cities."
  tech_water_extracting
  tech_water_extracting:0 "Water Extraction"
  tech_water_extracting_desc:1 "Extract and store water to be used in terraforming projects."
